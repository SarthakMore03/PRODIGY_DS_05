# PRODIGY_DS_05
You are on a roll! Task 05 is particularly interesting because it involves working with large-scale real-world data and geospatial elements (hotspots). This is a great opportunity to show off your ability to handle complex datasets.

Here is a structured README for Task 05.

Traffic Accident Data Analysis (Prodigy InfoTech - Task 05)
📋 Project Overview
As part of my Data Science internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I completed Task 05, which involves analyzing a comprehensive dataset of traffic accidents. The goal was to identify patterns, environmental contributing factors, and geographical hotspots to better understand road safety.

📊 Objectives
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.

Visualize accident hotspots using geographical mapping.

Determine the primary contributing factors to accident severity.

📂 Dataset
The analysis was performed using the US Accidents Dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA.

Dataset Link: US Accidents (2016-2023)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python: Primary analysis tool.

Pandas: Data cleaning and handling large-scale CSV files.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Statistical visualizations (Time of day, Weather impact).

Folium / Plotly: Geospatial mapping for accident hotspots.

🔍 Key Analysis Steps
Time Analysis: Investigating when accidents occur most frequently (e.g., rush hour, night vs. day).

Environmental Factors: Correlating accident frequency with weather conditions (Rain, Snow, Fog) and road features (Junctions, Stop signs).

Hotspot Mapping: Creating a heatmap to identify specific cities or coordinate points with the highest accident density.

Severity Analysis: Analyzing which factors contribute most to high-severity accidents.

📈 Key Insights
Peak Hours: [Example: Accidents peak between 7:00 AM - 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM, correlating with work commutes.]

Weather Impact: [Example: Clear weather surprisingly shows more accidents than rain, potentially due to higher traffic volume or driver overconfidence.]

Top Hotspots: [Example: Miami and Los Angeles were identified as the cities with the highest frequency of reported incidents.]
